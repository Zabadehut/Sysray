# Pulsar Metrics Matrix

Legend:

- `Implemented`: real code exists and is wired
- `Partial`: some support exists, but not yet with parity-complete depth or identical OS semantics
- `Planned`: intentionally part of the roadmap, not implemented yet
- `Out of Scope (Current Phase)`: not currently targeted for the active phase

| Process | Threads count | Implemented | Partial | Partial | baseline thread counts exist on macOS and Windows |
| Process | FD count | Implemented | Implemented | Partial | macOS counts open descriptors; Windows exposes handle count as the nearest equivalent |
| Process | User attribution | Implemented | Partial | Partial | macOS user attribution exists; Windows now resolves owners when the OS allows it |
| Process | IO read/write bytes | Implemented | Implemented | Implemented | macOS uses `proc_pid_rusage`; Windows uses Win32 process IO counters |
| Process | JVM detection | Partial | Partial | Partial | simple heuristics only |
| System | Hostname / OS / kernel / uptime / CPU count | Implemented | Implemented | Implemented | real across all three; field naming still follows OS-native conventions |

## Interpretation

Today, Pulsar is best described as:

- a working Linux observability foundation
- a cross-platform runtime with baseline macOS and Windows host coverage
- a roadmap-bearing product, not yet a parity-complete cross-platform product

It should not yet be described as:

- full macOS support
- full Windows support
- enterprise-ready
- infinitely scalable
