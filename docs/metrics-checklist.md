## Immediate Gaps Worth Closing First

These are the highest-leverage missing or partial items relative to current product claims:

- [ ] Broader Linux collector test coverage
- [ ] Deeper macOS collector parity
- [ ] Deeper Windows collector parity
- [ ] Replay mode
- [ ] Better JVM awareness
- [ ] Measured overhead benchmarks
- [ ] Container / cgroup v2 support
- [ ] PSI on Linux

## Recommendation

Near-term execution order:

1. Finish V1 quality gaps on Linux
2. Validate and complete real macOS and Windows support
3. Add differentiating modern Linux metrics such as cgroup v2 and PSI
4. Only then invest in larger platform features such as anomaly detection, correlation, and distributed scale
