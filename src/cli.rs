Scheduling examples:

Linux cron tasks:
  */5 * * * * /home/<user>/dev/pulsar/scripts/pulsar-daily-snapshot.sh
  0 2 */15 * * /home/<user>/dev/pulsar/scripts/pulsar-prune-raw.sh
  30 2 * * * /home/<user>/dev/pulsar/scripts/pulsar-archive-raw.sh

Linux task intent:
  1) append snapshots into ~/.local/share/pulsar/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
  2) rotate raw files by hour/day/size when needed
  3) keep raw retention bounded with --keep

macOS launchd:
  pulsar service install
  launchctl list | grep com.zabadehut.pulsar

Windows Task Scheduler:
  pulsar.exe service install
  schtasks /Query /TN Pulsar /V /FO LIST

Built-in service integration:
  Linux: systemd --user
  macOS: launchd LaunchAgent
  Windows: Task Scheduler

Reference and explain:
  pulsar explain latency
  pulsar explain swap --lang en --audience beginner
