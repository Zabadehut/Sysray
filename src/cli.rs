Scheduling examples:

Linux cron tasks:
  */5 * * * * /home/<user>/dev/pulsar/scripts/pulsar-daily-snapshot.sh
  0 2 */15 * * /home/<user>/dev/pulsar/scripts/pulsar-prune-raw.sh
  30 2 * * * /home/<user>/dev/pulsar/scripts/pulsar-archive-raw.sh

Linux task intent:
  1) append snapshots into ~/.local/share/pulsar/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
  2) remove raw .jsonl files older than 15 days
  3) zip files older than 15 days and newer than 60 days into ~/.local/share/pulsar/archives

macOS launchd:
  pulsar service install
  launchctl list | grep dev.kvdb.pulsar

Windows Task Scheduler:
  pulsar.exe service install
  schtasks /Query /TN Pulsar /V /FO LIST

Built-in service integration:
  Linux: systemd --user
  macOS: launchd LaunchAgent
  Windows: Task Scheduler
